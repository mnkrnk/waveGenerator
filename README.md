wave generator.
through a simple GUI we can input amplitude, sample rate, frequency, phase, duration and a fade out curve. The program will generate the waveform, display it in a visualizer and export a .wav file we can use in wavetable synths and such.

not my best code, but it works so i guess it's not that bad :p
